# SCOUT ECM Summaries

## Options
On the left side of this page you may select some options for which plots, and
how plots are presented.

For financial metrics you can report a aggregated value or a unique line for
each ecm.

The "Subset ECMs" options will let you plot for all ecms, useful for financial
merics, or select specific ECMs.  When the radio button for "Select Specific
ECM(s)" is active a selection box will be available.  _Multiple selections are
possible_ on Mac - hold the command key while clicking on the wanted ECMs.  A
single click without the command key compressed will revert to a single
selection.
